This Java project is meant to be the backend for the Qiyanna project. The ultimate
goal is to offer Data aggregation and offer and API that will deliver it. 
Since the official Riot API does not have general stats, and the only other option
is the champions.gg API.

## Development environment  
### Needed:
 * A mongodb server running on default port (consider having it running in a docker to make life easier).
 * Have an API key from riot, and set it as an environment variable
